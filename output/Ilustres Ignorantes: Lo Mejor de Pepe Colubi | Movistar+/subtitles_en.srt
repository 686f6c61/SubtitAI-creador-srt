1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
My relationship with sport is one of absolute contempt.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,080
I think sport is crap.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,480
One day, for whatever reason, I was a creative person,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
I was...

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
lively.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Hahahahaha!

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,560
And then, a teacher gave us a test

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,799
and asked us to leave the test when time was up

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,120
and he was going to collect it.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,680
So I, with my arms crossed,

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,080
put the exam on my head.

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Hahahahaha!

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,200
I made his job easier, from my point of view.

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,360
He was coming from behind,

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,000
and I, well, with my arms crossed,

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,879
I made it easier for him, from my point of view.

17
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:30,959
He was coming from behind.

18
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,759
Well, so, what did this guy do, who I hope is watching me?

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,240
He left the exams

20
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,520
and slapped me from behind.

21
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:38,599
Hahahahaha!

22
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,639
But a slap that, like cartoons,

23
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,520
left the exam in the air and me on the ground.

24
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,599
Hahahahaha!

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
Pepe, when did you first discover

26
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,639
that your family wasn't rich?

27
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,439
Right after killing them.

28
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,439
Who thought it was so urgent to carry a nail clipper around

29
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,439
to add a keychain function to it?

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Hahahahaha!

31
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,000
I would propose that person as president of the government.

32
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Hahahahaha!

33
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,200
Because we are seeing that anyone is suitable.

34
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:02,279
Hahahahahaha!

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
I am always the one who starts the conga line at weddings.

36
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,000
I always like it, I grab, you know?

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,000
The typical aunt, grandmother, single, older,

38
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,480
who is a bag of bones.

39
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:15,120
I always grab her and lift her a little.

40
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,959
Then, everyone believes...

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,000
Everyone believes that she leads us,

42
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,239
but, in addition, as they are...

43
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Hahahahaha!

44
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,120
As they are fibrous, I move her like this and she moves her arms.

45
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,199
Hahahahaha!

46
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,839
So, I got so carried away that once I did it, look,

47
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:32,919
at a funeral.

48
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,599
I'm not afraid because I'm...

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,480
drunken and adventurous,

50
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:40,440
but when I sleep I have no control over nightmares.

51
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm terrified of falling asleep

52
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,800
and Bill Cosby sneaking into my bed at night.

53
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,879
Hahahahaha!

54
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,440
I believe dancing was invented by Stephen Hawking.

55
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,559
Hahahahaha!

56
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:53,919
No, no.

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Uh...

58
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Damn, don't laugh that...

59
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,199
it almost cost him his life, look at how he ended up.

60
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,279
Hahahahaha!

61
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,480
What would you like to discover, Pepe?

62
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:06,680
Well, the obvious thing would be to say a vaccine against cancer, right?

63
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,320
But it's that...

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,960
cancer took my mother-in-law, I am very grateful to cancer.

65
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,039
Hahahahaha!

66
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,279
I once went to the zarzuela racetrack

67
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,759
to see what horse racing was like.

68
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,520
In the first race there was a horse named Newman.

69
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,039
And I remembered the postman from Seinfeld.

70
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,559
And I bet on Newman. And he won the race.

71
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,919
I won 5 euros with 40 cents because my bet had been miserable.

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hahahahaha!

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,559
Then I went to the next race and a horse named Joy Division ran.

74
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,759
And I bet everything I had and he came last.

75
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,839
Hahahahaha!

76
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,240
What have I learned? Nothing!

77
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Hahahahahaha!

78
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,320
I know that many people who hear this will think that I am heartless,

79
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,559
but I have masturbated behind my girlfriend's back.

80
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,639
Hahahahaha!

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,919
I donâ€™t mean on her behind while she was sleeping, although also.

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hahahahaha!

83
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:58,720
I mean, if she's in the room next door,

84
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,080
I've masturbated thinking about other women.

85
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Hahahahaha!

86
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,479
Hahahahaha!

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,119
I want to come out here with a catheter and in diapers.

88
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,199
Hahahahaha!

89
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,080
And unshaven.

90
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:17,520
But not because I'm very old, next week if possible.

91
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Hahahahaha!

92
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,839
With the nightgown behind? Open from the back.

93
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,800
Do you have a date? A polka dot nightgown.

94
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,479
Do you have a date? A rectal examination.

95
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,960
Ah, you see! Of course! Hahahaha!

96
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,639
You only need to masturbate compulsively in case,

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,320
by chance, your ejaculation coincides,

98
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:37,039
wherever she is, with an orgasm from Monica Bellucci.

99
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,759
Once my girlfriend said, anal sex today.

100
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,839
Hahahahaha!

101
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,160
I said, come on, okay, I'm prepared.

102
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,279
And she took out a belt dildo worn by her.

103
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Hahahahaha!

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,279
Strapon, it's called, right? Strapon.

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Strapon.

106
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,279
Then she told me it was a seated prank,

107
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,199
but she saw me so enthusiastic that she put it in me bent.

108
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:58,800
I've masturbated thinking about me.

109
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,759
Hahahahaha!

110
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:05,559
But, beware, with greed, thinking about a threesome with two me's.

111
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,639
Hahahahaha!

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Ah, yes.

113
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,119
So, looking at it and suddenly realizing

114
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,880
and that, from a subjective point of view, my three selves are looking at me.

115
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,720
So I realized that there are four of us.

116
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,399
I'm tripping over your idyllic vision of school.

117
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,359
A place where you have to fucking get up early every day.

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
That, that.

119
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,799
Are you telling me that you, as a child,

120
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,000
with your 12 years, with your hairs or the eggs already,

121
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,880
going to class at nine was getting up early?

122
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,079
Sorry, Isabel.

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,519
Did you get up? Was going to class at nine getting up early?

124
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,519
Since you mention hairs and eggs,

125
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,640
I had a lot to do at night, okay?

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Hahahahaha!

127
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:45,119
I propose a subject, also. Brown sciences.

128
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,839
There are the natural ones, which is very good, there are the social ones,

129
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,760
but brown sciences that teach you to get by

130
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,839
in difficult situations in life, right?

131
